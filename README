This is my first attempt at a complete Python 3 program. It's purpose is to determine how many types
of each file are in a selected location (and any subfolders). It utilises a tkinter GUI interface and
commands from the os module.

Under Linux, run the main.pyw file (ideally set as an executable text file). I can't be 100% sure of the 
results under Windows due to the use of \ rather than /
